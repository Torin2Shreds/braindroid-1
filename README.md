Android App for EEG and BCI

Right now it works with [OpenBCI](http://openbci.com/). At the moment it is only able to record to file.

A nice UI and the ability to share files with gDrive/ email/ usb/ whatever will be added soon, as well as pretty real-time visualisations.
I also hope to support devices other than OpenBCI.
